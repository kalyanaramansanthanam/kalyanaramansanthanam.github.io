This is my first post attempting to use Jekyll and publishing using Github's free hosting service. 
I have been meaning to try posting something here for a really long time but held back coz I didn't know what I would post about.

My first attempt to post a contact me page didn't seem to work. Why don't things ever just work right the first time I try it (sigh)

So, Let's see if at least this works.
